This is to list desired properties of function parameters, returns, or class attributes/methods.

## Function Parameters
- variable name
- variable type : int, float, str etc. are clear. 
    - if can take both array-like and single float/int type, this should be mentioned 
    - if not basic python type: explain what kind of object eg. `numpy.ndarray`. Note this is what we would get if we checked for type of an instance of that object. If linking to this quantity somewhere can be achieved, that is even better.
    - units for dimensionful quantities 
    - optional or mandatory. What it defaults to if optional
